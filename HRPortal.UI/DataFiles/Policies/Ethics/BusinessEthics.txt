FAIRNESS: We will create and follow a process and achieve outcomes that a reasonable person would call just, evenhanded and nonarbitrary.

RESPECT FOR OTHERS: We will be open and direct in our communication, and receptive to influence. We will honor and value the abilities and contributions of others, embracing the responsibility and accountability for our actions in this regard.

COMPASSION: We will maintain an awareness of the needs of others and act to meet those needs whenever possible. We will also minimize harm whenever possible. We will act in ways that are consistent with our commitment to social responsibility.
